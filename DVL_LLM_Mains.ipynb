        "Overview\n",
        "Temporal analysis and visualization techniques are used to answer \"When\" questions. These techniques help identify trends, bursts, seasonality, and patterns over time. Different approaches are required to manage various time-related challenges such as aggregation, time zones, outliers, and time slicing.\n",
        "\n",
        "Data Preprocessing\n",
        "A time series consists of events or observations ordered in one dimension: time. It may be:\n",
        "- Continuous: Observations recorded at equal intervals (e.g., every second).\n",
        "- Discrete: Observations recorded irregularly (e.g., event-driven logs).\n",
        "\n",
        "Temporal information can be static (fixed dates) or dynamic (real-time data streams).\n",
        "\n",
        "Resolution and Aggregation\n",
        "- Time can be expressed in milliseconds, seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, years, decades, centuries.\n",
        "- Aggregation can be based on astronomical time (e.g., years, seasons) or cultural time (e.g., fiscal years, business quarters).\n",
        "\n",
        "Time Zones\n",
        "Different regions use different time zones. Aligning data across time zones ensures correct comparisons.\n",
        "\n",
        "Outliers\n",
        "- Definition: Extreme values that deviate significantly from normal patterns.\n",
        "- Example: A sudden traffic spike on a website due to viral content.\n",
        "- Outliers can be filtered out or highlighted for deeper investigation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Time Slicing\n",
        "- Disjoint Slicing: Separates time intervals completely.\n",
        "- Overlapping Slicing: Allows segments to share part of the time range.\n",
        "- Cumulative Slicing: Accumulates data across periods (e.g., rolling averages).\n",
        "\n",
        "Temporal Trends and Patterns\n",
        "A time series can be broken down into:\n",
        "1. General Trends: Long-term progression.\n",
        "2. Cyclical Components: Recurring changes (e.g., business cycles).\n",
        "3. Seasonal Components: Repeating yearly patterns (e.g., winter sales).\n",
        "4. Random Components: Unpredictable variations.\n",
        "\n",
        "To analyze trends, smoothing techniques can be applied (e.g., moving averages).\n",
        "\n",
        "Bursts\n",
        "- Definition: A sudden increase in activity for a short period.\n",
        "- Example: An unexpected surge in search engine queries.\n",
        "- Burst detection algorithms identify and rank significant events.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. Trends and Distributions\n",
        "- Timeline/Chronological Graphs: Show event occurrences over time.\n",
        "- Bar Graphs: Used for discrete time segments.\n",
        "- Line Graphs: Highlight trends in continuous time series.\n",
        "- Histograms: Show frequency distributions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: Stock price trends over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Time-Based Comparisons\n",
        "- Stacked Bar Graphs: Compare multiple datasets over time.\n",
        "- 100% Stacked Line Graphs: Show relative proportions.\n",
        "- Circular Time Graphs: Represent periodic patterns (e.g., hourly energy usage).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Flows Over Time\n",
        "- Flow Maps: Show movement and volume of entities over time (e.g., migration patterns).\n",
        "- Space-Time Cube Maps: Represent data in three dimensions (X, Y for space, Z for time).\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: Hurricane track visualization.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Derivatives and Change Detection\n",
        "- Velocity & Acceleration Graphs: Analyze change rates (e.g., stock market fluctuations).\n",

        "Application of Temporal Studies\n",
        "1. Finance: Stock price trends, inflation changes.\n",

        "        Geospatial analysis (or geostatistical analysis) helps answer \"Where\" questions by using statistical methods and spatial data visualization techniques. It focuses on understanding the location of objects, relationships between places, movement patterns, and spatial clustering. This is useful in fields such as geography, urban planning, epidemiology, and logistics.\n",

        "\n",
        "        Geocoding\n",
        "        - Converts addresses, postal codes, or geographic coordinates into mappable locations.\n",
        "        - Uses geographic gazetteers or GPS satellite triangulation to pinpoint positions.\n",
        "\n",
        "        Distance Calculation\n",
        "        - Measures shortest paths between locations using Great Circle Distance (Earth’s curvature).\n",
        "        - Used in routing, logistics, and disaster response planning.\n",
        "\n",
        "        Diffusion Matrices\n",
        "        - Used to model movement of tangible objects (e.g., vehicles, goods, money) and intangible elements (e.g., ideas, rumors, reputation).\n",

States with higher average salaries can be represented with darker shades, while states with lower average salaries can be represented with lighter shades. This allows for a clear visual representation of the salary distribution across the map. Using color hue would be less effective as it is better suited for categorical data, which is not the case here. Size is not applicable as the areas (states) are already defined geographically.
